# LifeMap
This is a simple app that provides a minimalist, at-a-glance view of life in another city for anyone that may be looking for a 
change in scenery. 

Lifemap is intended to avoid overloading the user with data, or endless scrolling through information in order to find the 
little bits that they care about. 

The technologies used to create this were Java, including the Java Spring Framework, ES6 Javascript, XML, CSS, HTML. Thymeleaf,
and Hibernate.

Also included are the three APIs that we used to gather and display the data which are: Google, Teleport, and OpenWeatherMaps.

# Usage
In order to use this code, you'll need an application.properties file with the keys to Google and OpenWeatherMaps APIs.

It will look like this:

google.maps.key=YOURKEYHERE

openweathermaps.key=YOURKEYHERE
